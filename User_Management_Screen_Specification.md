# User Management Screen Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the user interface (UI) specifications for the User Management screen. The screen allows administrators to manage user accounts, including creating new users, editing existing users, and filtering the list of users.

## Requirements
- The system should allow administrators to view, add, edit, and delete user accounts.
- The user list should support filtering to hide disabled users.
- The interface should provide immediate feedback on user actions (e.g., saving a user, displaying validation errors).

## Initial State
Upon loading, the User Management screen should display a list of all active users in a table. The "New User" form on the right-hand side should be empty and ready for new input. The "Hide Disabled User" checkbox should be unchecked by default.

## UI Components and Behavior

### 1. **User List Table**
- **Columns**: ID, User Name, Email, Enabled
- **Behavior**:
  - The table displays all users, with each user on a separate row.
  - Clicking on a column header will sort the list by that column.
  - If the "Hide Disabled User" checkbox is checked, the table will only show users where `Enabled = true`.

### 2. **New User Button**
- **Behavior**:
  - Clicking on this button clears any data in the "New User" form and allows the admin to input new user information.
  - The button is always enabled and visible.

### 3. **Hide Disabled User Checkbox**
- **Behavior**:
  - When checked, the user list will automatically refresh to hide any users where `Enabled = false`.
  - When unchecked, the list will display all users, regardless of their enabled status.

### 4. **New User Form**
- **Fields**:
  - Username (Text Field)
  - Display Name (Text Field)
  - Phone (Text Field)
  - Email (Text Field)
  - User Roles (Dropdown Multi-select)
  - Enabled (Checkbox)
- **Behavior**:
  - The form fields should be validated to ensure that required fields are not empty and that the email format is correct.
  - The "Enabled" checkbox determines whether the user account is active.
  - The "User Roles" dropdown allows selecting multiple roles for the user.

### 5. **Save User Button**
- **Behavior**:
  - Clicking the "Save User" button should validate the form inputs and then save the new or edited user data.
  - If the form is valid, the user information is updated or added to the list, and the form is cleared.
  - If there are validation errors, appropriate messages should be displayed near the corresponding fields.

## Error Handling
- If the user tries to save without filling required fields, a message should be displayed indicating which fields are missing or incorrect.
- In case of server errors while saving the user, a generic error message should be displayed at the top of the form.

## Confirmation Messages
- Upon successfully saving a user, a confirmation message should be displayed to the user, indicating the success of the operation.

## Accessibility Considerations
- All form controls should be properly labeled.
- Keyboard navigation should be supported for all interactive elements.
- Validation messages should be announced by screen readers.

## Notes
- The system should be designed to be responsive, ensuring usability on various screen sizes.
